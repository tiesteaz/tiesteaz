- 👋 Hi, I’m Andrey Baranov @tiesteaz
- 👀 I’m interested in learning MLOps, Python, C#, Kubernetes and other technologies towards modern data science.
- 🌱 I’m currently enrolled into Udacity MLOps Nano program, and will be using this github as a place to store results of my course projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on MLOps technics, on any hints that help to be fast, effective, and skillful programmer.
- 📫 How to reach me: tiesteaz@gmail.com
